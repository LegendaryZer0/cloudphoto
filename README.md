To before starting app please check java version(need 17).

Next, download the jar application from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rrg7lfpreGdjhvvuaWBXWpLtuVoJsTUA/view?usp=sharing) -recommended, or try to build it with the command:
```./mvnw clean package``` (make sure your JAVA_HOME env. var. is 17 and now you in project root directory).
